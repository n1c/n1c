### I like building things. 👷 

Hello, I'm Nic! I've spent the last 15+ years writing code for startups and small companies remotely and in Cape Town where I'm based, namely SaaS Mates, Datawisp, Superbalist & Bikehub. All of which have been amazing experiences.

Most of that time has been spent writing web tools in Laravel. While recently I've been spending my free time writing tools for exploring Counter-Strike demo file data in Typescript.
