### 👷  I like building things.

Hello, I'm Nic! I've spent the last few years writing code for startups in the Silicon Cape. All of which have been amazing experiences. In their own ways they've granted me the opportunity to learn and build with a great number of different technologies.

Most of that time has been spent writing web tools in Laravel. While recently I've been spending my free time learning Unity/C# and writing small game experiments.
